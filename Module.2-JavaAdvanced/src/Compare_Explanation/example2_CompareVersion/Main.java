package Compare_Explanation.example2_CompareVersion;/*
example_ComparableVersion show natural ordering with Comparable, letâ€™s see how we can use other types of ordering in a more
flexible manner than by directly implementing an interface.

The Comparator interface defines a compare(arg1, arg2) method with two arguments that represent compared objects,
and works similarly to the Comparable.compareTo() method.
