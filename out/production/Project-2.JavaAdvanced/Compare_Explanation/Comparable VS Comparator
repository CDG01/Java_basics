Comparator vs Comparable

source: https://www.baeldung.com/java-comparator-comparable

The Comparable interface is a good choice to use for defining the default ordering,
or in other words, if it’s the main way of comparing objects.

So why use a Comparator if we already have Comparable?

There are several reasons why:

1. Sometimes we can’t modify the source code of the class whose objects we want to sort, thus making the use of Comparable impossible
2. Using Comparators allows us to avoid adding additional code to our domain classes
3. We can define multiple different comparison strategies, which isn’t possible when using Comparable
